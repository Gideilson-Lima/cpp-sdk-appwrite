![banner-appwrite](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/63e7dbad-6a49-4b80-bee2-8e0a46601eec)

## Overview

This C++ SDK is built from scratch as a prototype for interacting with Appwrite's backend services. It allows users to perform a limited set of functionalities, including the creation of databases, collections, and documents, while also enabling the retrieval of usage statistics and management of storage and account health.

## Features

The SDK offers essential features for database management, including the ability to create databases with authentication checks. Users can create collections within these databases and define various attributes for each collection. Additionally, the SDK supports the creation of document indexes, which facilitate efficient querying. Users can retrieve usage statistics for both databases and collections, enabling them to monitor performance and resource utilization. Moreover, the SDK includes functionalities for managing storage classes and checking the health status of the application, along with basic account management capabilities.
